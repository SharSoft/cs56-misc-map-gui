cs56-misc-map-gui

if it is possible to merge this project with https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-calculatewalkingtime/blob/master/html/index.html
I could see it as a good way ot take this project. Alternatively it could be better if you could even look at two buildings at once ie youare here, you need to get there autohighlighting. but this might be difficult...
